This is a crazy project. We all know that the mid 2020 had all the fun with the Binod trending in YouTube, Twitter and every where.
But it landed onto disgusting spamming from the meme world. In this project I have made a simple Binod detector to filter out spam documents.
The uploaded version here is dedicated for documents of .txt and .pdf format but it can be further improvised for utilisation with
.xlsx and other doc formats. 

So contributions are welcome!!!
